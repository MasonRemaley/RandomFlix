# RandomFlix

This simple bookmarklet developed over a 36 hour period at <a href="https://bitca.mp" target="_blank">Bitcamp</a> gives Netflix TV shows a random-episode functionality. Netflix doesn't have a public API, so RandomFlix is dependent on implementation details. We'll do our best to maintain it if Netflix changes their interface.

For information on using RandomFlix, see <a href="http://masonremaley.github.io/RandomFlix/">our website.</a> If you have any issues using it, <a href="https://github.com/MasonRemaley/RandomFlix/issues">let us know.</a>
