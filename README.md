# RandomFlix

This simple bookmarklet developed at <a href="https://bitca.mp" target="_blank">Bitcamp</a> gives Netflix TV shows a random-episode functionality. Netflix doesn't have a public API, so RandomFlix is dependent on implementation details. If it comes to my attention that a change on Netflix's part breaks RandomFlix I'll do my best to update it or say something about it here.
